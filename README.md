### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Akemi Pereowei Isreal, also known as Morbykat and I'm a Frontend Developer, passionate about sustainable development and finding innovative solutions to complex problems. Welcome to my GitHub page!

### ðŸ’«About me:
I'm new to the world of web development, but I'm excited to learn as much as I can. I'm currently focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm eager to explore more advanced topics like React and Node.js. I enjoy writing or reading novels and playing board games with my friends and family.
